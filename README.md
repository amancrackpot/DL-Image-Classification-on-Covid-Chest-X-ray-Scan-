# Image-Classification-on-Covid-Chest-X-ray-Scan
#### The goal of this system is to identify from a chest X-ray scan image the presence of the following :
- Normal
- Covid
- Viral Pneumonia

### Simple Web App available at: https://xray-scan-classifier.onrender.com/

#### The code needed to train the model is detailed in here https://github.com/amancrackpot/ImageClassification_Covid_X_Ray_Scans/blob/main/covid-classification-resnet50.ipynb
I have used transfer learning by making use of pre-trained resnet50 and finetuning it

#### Dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
