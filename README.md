# Image-Classification-on-Covid-Chest-X-ray-Scan
#### The goal of this system is to classify a chest X-ray scan(image) as one of the following :
- Normal i.e lungs are healthy
- Covid i.e lungs show presence of covid
- Viral Pneumonia i.e lungs show presence of viral-pneumonia

#### The code needed to train the model is detailed in here https://github.com/amancrackpot/ImageClassification_Covid_X_Ray_Scans/blob/main/covid-classification-resnet50.ipynb
I have used transfer learning by making use of pre-trained resnet50 and finetuning it
